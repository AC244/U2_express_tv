## Introduction

With our Express Controllers, we can add as much functionality as we want into our back end server, but still be able to keep our files clean and streamlined. This is a great option when working with multiple data sets!

For this lab, lets create a back end server that renders data for TV shows, detailing different shows and genres

### Requirements

- An Express Server with Index and Show routes for at least 3 different data models - Comedies, Documentaries, and Dramas (or anything else you'd like to work on if you have different TV tastes!)
- At least 3 objects within each Index Route
- The ability to show an individual object by its Id and Name in a respective route for each
- There is no limit to what you can do with each, but take some time to think of what your data should look like for each tv show - Name? Episode Length? Description... what else will you want to add?
-  Your functions to view Index and Show routes for each genre must be tucked into a Controllers directory, with a file for each genre

### Bonus!
- Filter through your shows by number of episodes, episode length, ratings, or anything else you can think of
- When you have your Localhost:3001 with all of the necessary routes, attach an HTML/CSS/JS front end to it!

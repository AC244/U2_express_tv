## Introduction

With our Express Controllers, we can add as much functionality as we want into our back end server, but still be able to keep our files clean and streamlined. This is a great option when working with multiple data sets!

For this lab, lets create a back end server that renders data for TV shows, detailing different shows and genres

### Requirements

- An Express Server with Index and Show routes for at least 3 different data models - Comedies, Documentaries, and Dramas (or anything else you'd like to work on if you have different TV tastes!)
- At least 3 TV Series objects within each Index Route
- The ability to show an individual object by its Id and Name in a respective route for each
- There is no limit to what you can do with each, but take some time to think of what your data should look like for each tv show - Name? Description? Date first aired... a boolean for whether the show is still running or not... what else will you want to add?
-  Your functions to view Index and Show routes for each genre must be tucked into a Controllers directory, with a file for each genre

### Bonus!
- Filter through your shows by number of episodes, ratings, only currently running shows... or anything else you can think of
- When you have your Localhost:3001 with all of the necessary routes, attach an HTML/CSS/JS front end to it!
- Have POST, PUT, and DELETE routes set as well. These will not techinically do anything yet, but it will be good practice for when we create true CRUD functionality later this week

  
### Additional :
- Anyone who says Family Guy is better than the Simpsons will be immediately removed from this class without hesitation.
